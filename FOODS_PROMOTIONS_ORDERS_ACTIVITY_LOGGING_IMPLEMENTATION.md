# Activity Logging Implementation for Foods, Promotions, and Orders

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive activity logging system implementation for the Foods, Promotions, and Orders sections in the JippyMart Admin Panel. All user actions are now tracked and logged to Firebase Firestore for real-time monitoring and audit purposes.

## Implemented Modules

### 1. Foods Module
**Location**: `resources/views/foods/`

#### Operations Logged:
- **Create**: `logActivity('foods', 'created', 'Created new food: [foodName]')`
- **Edit**: `logActivity('foods', 'updated', 'Updated food: [foodName]')`
- **Delete**: `logActivity('foods', 'deleted', 'Deleted food: [foodName]')`
- **Bulk Delete**: `logActivity('foods', 'bulk_deleted', 'Bulk deleted foods: [foodNames]')`
- **Publish**: `logActivity('foods', 'published', 'Published food: [foodName]')`
- **Unpublish**: `logActivity('foods', 'unpublished', 'Unpublished food: [foodName]')`
- **Make Available**: `logActivity('foods', 'made_available', 'Made food available: [foodName]')`
- **Make Unavailable**: `logActivity('foods', 'made_unavailable', 'Made food unavailable: [foodName]')`

#### Files Modified:
- `resources/views/foods/create.blade.php` - Added logging for food creation
- `resources/views/foods/edit.blade.php` - Added logging for food editing
- `resources/views/foods/index.blade.php` - Added logging for delete, bulk delete, and toggle operations

### 2. Promotions Module
**Location**: `resources/views/promotions/`

#### Operations Logged:
- **Create**: `logActivity('promotions', 'created', 'Created new promotion with special price: ‚Çπ[price]')`
- **Edit**: `logActivity('promotions', 'updated', 'Updated promotion with special price: ‚Çπ[price]')`
- **Delete**: `logActivity('promotions', 'deleted', 'Deleted promotion: Special price: ‚Çπ[price]')`
- **Bulk Delete**: `logActivity('promotions', 'bulk_deleted', 'Bulk deleted promotions: [promotionInfo]')`
- **Make Available**: `logActivity('promotions', 'made_available', 'Made promotion available: [promotionInfo]')`
- **Make Unavailable**: `logActivity('promotions', 'made_unavailable', 'Made promotion unavailable: [promotionInfo]')`

#### Files Modified:
- `resources/views/promotions/create.blade.php` - Added logging for promotion creation
- `resources/views/promotions/edit.blade.php` - Added logging for promotion editing
- `resources/views/promotions/index.blade.php` - Added logging for delete, bulk delete, and toggle operations

### 3. Orders Module
**Location**: `resources/views/orders/`

#### Operations Logged:
- **Accept Order**: `logActivity('orders', 'accepted', 'Accepted order #[orderId] with preparation time: [time] minutes')`
- **Status Update**: `logActivity('orders', 'status_updated', 'Updated order #[orderId] status to: [status]')`
- **Delete**: `logActivity('orders', 'deleted', 'Deleted [orderInfo]')`
- **Bulk Delete**: `logActivity('orders', 'bulk_deleted', 'Bulk deleted orders: [orderInfo]')`

#### Files Modified:
- `resources/views/orders/edit.blade.php` - Added logging for order acceptance and status updates
- `resources/views/orders/index.blade.php` - Added logging for delete and bulk delete operations

## Technical Implementation Details

### Frontend Integration
All operations use the global `logActivity()` function from `public/js/global-activity-logger.js`:

```javascript
await logActivity(module, action, description);
```

### Data Retrieval
Before logging, the system retrieves relevant data to create meaningful descriptions:
- **Foods**: Retrieves food name from `vendor_products` collection
- **Promotions**: Retrieves special price from `promotions` collection
- **Orders**: Retrieves order status and ID from `restaurant_orders` collection

### Error Handling
Comprehensive error handling is implemented:
- Try-catch blocks around all logging operations
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful fallback if `logActivity` function is not available

### Asynchronous Operations
All logging operations are properly awaited to ensure completion before page navigation:
- Uses `async/await` pattern
- Prevents `NS_BINDING_ABORTED` errors
- Ensures logs are recorded before redirects

## Log Data Structure

Each log entry in Firebase Firestore contains:
```json
{
  "user_id": "admin_user_id",
  "user_type": "admin",
  "role": "super_admin",
  "module": "foods|promotions|orders",
  "action": "created|updated|deleted|bulk_deleted|published|unpublished|made_available|made_unavailable|accepted|status_updated",
  "description": "Human-readable description of the action",
  "ip_address": "192.168.1.1",
  "user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0...",
  "created_at": "2025-01-XX..."
}
```

## Testing

### Automated Tests
Run the comprehensive test script:
```bash
php test_foods_promotions_orders_comprehensive.php
```

### Manual Testing Checklist

#### Foods Section:
- [ ] Create a new food item
- [ ] Edit an existing food item
- [ ] Delete a food item
- [ ] Bulk delete multiple food items
- [ ] Toggle publish/unpublish status
- [ ] Toggle available/unavailable status

#### Promotions Section:
- [ ] Create a new promotion
- [ ] Edit an existing promotion
- [ ] Delete a promotion
- [ ] Bulk delete multiple promotions
- [ ] Toggle available/unavailable status

#### Orders Section:
- [ ] Accept an order
- [ ] Update order status
- [ ] Delete an order
- [ ] Bulk delete multiple orders

#### Activity Logs Verification:
- [ ] Navigate to Activity Logs page
- [ ] Verify all operations are logged
- [ ] Check correct module names, actions, and descriptions
- [ ] Verify real-time updates
- [ ] Check user information is correctly logged

## Browser Console Monitoring

All operations include console logging for debugging:
- ‚úÖ Success messages with operation details
- üîç Debug information about logging calls
- ‚ùå Error messages if logging fails

## Dependencies

- **Backend**: Laravel ActivityLogger service
- **Frontend**: Global `logActivity()` function
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **API**: `/api/activity-logs/log` endpoint
- **CSRF**: Exempted in `VerifyCsrfToken` middleware

## Cache Management

After implementation, clear Laravel caches:
```bash
php artisan config:clear
php artisan view:clear
php artisan route:clear
```

## Security Considerations

- CSRF protection bypassed only for activity logging endpoint
- User authentication required for all operations
- IP address and user agent tracking for audit trails
- Secure Firebase credentials management

## Performance Impact

- Minimal performance impact due to asynchronous logging
- Non-blocking operations ensure smooth user experience
- Firebase Firestore provides real-time updates without page refresh

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Add filtering by module, action, or date range
- Implement log export functionality
- Add user activity analytics dashboard
- Implement log retention policies
- Add email notifications for critical operations

## Support

For issues or questions regarding the activity logging system:
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify Firebase connectivity
3. Ensure all caches are cleared
4. Run the comprehensive test script
5. Check Activity Logs page for real-time verification
