### Activity Logs UI Features

#### 1. Select All Functionality
```javascript
$('#select-all-logs').on('change', function() {
    $('.log-checkbox').prop('checked', $(this).prop('checked'));
    updateBulkDeleteButton();
});
```

#### 2. Individual Checkbox Handling
```javascript
$(document).on('change', '.log-checkbox', function() {
    updateBulkDeleteButton();
    // Update select all checkbox state
});
```

#### 3. Bulk Delete Functionality
```javascript
$(document).on('click', '.bulk-delete-logs', function() {
    var selectedLogs = $('.log-checkbox:checked');
    // Delete selected logs from Firestore
});
```

#### 4. Dynamic Delete Button

## UI Features

- **Log ID value**: Checkbox value contains the Firestore document ID
- **Consistent styling**: Matches the food management interface design

### Bulk Actions

- **Confirmation dialog**: Asks user to confirm deletion
- **Loading state**: Shows spinner during deletion process
