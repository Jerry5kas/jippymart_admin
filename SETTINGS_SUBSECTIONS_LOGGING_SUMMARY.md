## Implementation Details

### Key Features
1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All CRUD operations and toggle actions are logged
2. **Detailed Descriptions**: Log entries include specific values and settings changed
3. **Real-time Logging**: All operations are logged immediately after successful execution
4. **Error Handling**: Proper async/await implementation prevents logging failures from affecting user operations
5. **Module-specific Logging**: Each module uses appropriate module names for easy filtering

### Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Added `await logActivity()` calls in all relevant JavaScript functions
- **Backend**: Uses existing `ActivityLogger` service and API endpoint
- **Database**: Logs stored in Firestore `activity_logs` collection
- **Real-time Updates**: Activity logs page shows live updates via Firebase listeners

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All settings subsections now have comprehensive activity logging implemented and tested. The system tracks every user action across all settings modules with detailed descriptions and real-time updates.

## Next Steps

With the settings subsections now fully implemented, the activity logging system is complete across all major modules of the admin panel. You can now:

1. **Monitor User Activity**: Use the Activity Logs page to track all admin actions in real-time
2. **Audit Trail**: Maintain complete audit trails for compliance and security
3. **User Behavior Analysis**: Analyze patterns in admin usage and settings changes
4. **Troubleshooting**: Quickly identify when and who made specific changes

The activity logging system is now production-ready and covers all major operations across the entire admin panel.
